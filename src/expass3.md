# Expass 3

## Step 1:
I had no issue in setting up the front vite project, this i had done before. However i tried to get the backend 
part of the project into a folder which was called ´backend´. This led to several issues in my code. I 
could not get the proper filing of the backend to work with this new file setup. So i dont have "backend" and "backend" directories. Spent several hours and i gave up in the end.

## Step 2:
In my creation of the project I discovered that when creating my frontend that my backend might lack a voteoptionController. 

Files created:

[CreatePoll.svelte]()
CreateUser.svelte
Polls.svelte
Vote.svelte
